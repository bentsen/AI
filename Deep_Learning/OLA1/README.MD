## 1. Based on your experience, how would you define ANN and CNN?
Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
ANNs are like a simplified version of the human brain's network. They consist of layers of nodes, or "neurons," connected together. These networks are flexible and can be used for different tasks like recognizing patterns or sorting data into categories. We found ANNs useful for general problems where the data doesnâ€™t have a specific arrangement or pattern.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
CNNs are designed to process data that has a clear arrangement, like images. They work by moving filters over the data to capture patterns such as edges or shapes, which helps in tasks like identifying objects in pictures. Through our tests, CNNs proved to be better for visual data because they focus on the spatial relationships within the data.

Our experiments showed that while both networks can tackle similar challenges, the choice between using an ANN or a CNN often depends on the type of data and what the task involves.

## 2. Which hyper-parameters of the CNN architecture have you fine-tuned?


## 3. Which is the role of the activation functions in ANN? Which of them you have implemented?
Illustrate them.


## 4. Can you see any advantages and disadvantages of ANN and CNN used for classification in
comparison to the other classification algorithms you are familiar with? Give some examples.
