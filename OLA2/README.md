# OLA 2

# CS2 Team Favor Predictor
## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI predictor for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) matches, predicting which team holds the advantage based on various in-game factors. These factors include the number of players alive on each team, their weapons, presence of defuse kits, and remaining time in the round.
