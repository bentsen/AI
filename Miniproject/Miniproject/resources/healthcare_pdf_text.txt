 Introduction to Denmark  
 
Denmark is in Northern Europe and is part of Scandinavia. The official language is Danish.  
 
Denmark has an area of 43,094 km2 and a population of 5.7 million people.  
Greenland and the Faeroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark but have autonomous self -rule. 
 
Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark and the most populated city with an urban population of 1.3 million 
people.  
 
Enacted in 1849, the Danish Constitutional Act lays down the framework of Danish democracy. The Act 
outlines the citizens’ rights or human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.  
The political system of Denmark is that of a multi -party structure where several parties can be represented in 
Parliament (Folketinget) at any one time. Danish governments are often characterised by minority 
administrations with one or more supporting part ies. Since 1909, no single party has held the majority in 
Parliament.  
 
Denmark is a member of the European Union, the Nordic Council of Ministers, the United Nations and 
NATO.  
 
Denmark has the highest employment rate in Europe (7 4 per cent  in 2015 ). In the last three years, the  World 
Bank  has ranked Denmark as the best country for business in Europe and third best in the world after 
Singapore and New Zealand. In addition, Transparency International ranked Denmark as the least corrupt 
country in the world  in 2015.  
 
The basic principle of the Danish welfare system, often referred to as the Scandinavian welfare model, is that 
all citizens have equal rights to social security. In the Danish welfare system, a number of services are 
available to citizens, free of charge.  
 
Education in Denmark is provided free of charge at all levels , and there are nine years of compulsory 
education  in primary and lower secondary school . Public expenditure on education and training corresponds 
to 7 per cent of the Denmark's GDP a nd around 13 per cent of total public expenditure.  
 
The Danish healthcare system is universal and based on the principles of free and equal access to 
healthcare for all citizens. The healthcare system offers high -quality services, the majority of which are  
financed by general taxes.  
 
Life expectancy in Denmark has increased from 77.9 years in 2005 to 80.6 years in 2015. Danish women 
have a higher life expectancy (82.5 years in 2015) than Danish men (78.6 years in 2015).

 Introduction to this Publication  
This publication provides an overview of the scope and organisation of health and elderly care in Denmark. 
Chapter 1 briefly describes the tasks and responsibilities at the different levels of government: the Ministry of 
Health, the regions and the municipalities , and it explains in overall terms how the healthcare system in 
Denmark is financed.  
 
Chapter 2 deals with patients’ rights in relation to treatment, diagnosis and free choice of hospital, including 
rules on treatment abroad. The system of patient advise rs, complaint procedures and compensation is 
explained, and a brief overview of the tasks of the Danish Patient Safety Authority related to adverse events 
and patient safety  is also given . 
 
General practitioners fill a key position in the Danish healthcare system . Their work and responsibilities are 
described in the Chapter  3, which also explains how rehabilitation contributes to public health  overall . 
Vaccinations are mentioned here too.  
 
Chapter 4 covers  the hospital system, including planning and distribution of both general and specialised 
hospital services and emergency units. This chapter also describes the ongoing expansion  of the Danish 
hospital infrastructure and implementation of innovative technology , the aim being to  modernis e the Danish 
hospital sector by 2020.  
 
Chapter 5 describes how elderly care is organised, including home care services, reablement program mes 
for elderly people, nursing homes and preventive measures.  
 
Chapter 6 on psychiatric care describes the new direction taken within  psychiatric care in recent years with a 
view to reducing the use of coercive measure s in psychiatric treatment and ensuring equal  access  and equal 
status for people with mental illness . 
 
Chapter 7 deals with health promotion and explains how measures within this important field are organised 
and implemented. It outlines specific initiatives in relation to a number of lifestyle  facto rs, such as alcohol 
smoking and tobacco, drugs, nutrition, obesity and physical activity. Mental health is covered here too. 
 
Denmark has made significant progress in the digitisation of the healthcare system. Chapter 8 elaborates on 
some of the goals already achieved as well as on future aims. This includes the use of electronic 
communication systems within the entire healthcare sector as well as outpatient treatment through 
telemonitoring of certain diseases. This chapt er also includes information on initiatives to promote systematic 
use of health data to support a more efficient and outcome -oriented healthcare system.  
 
Chapter 9 describes the rules and regulations that govern medicines and pharmacies, including 
pharmaco vigilance, procurement and pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as reimbursement available 
to patients. This chapter also briefly touches upon health research , including  ethical issues .  
  
3 
 The last chapter provides a more detailed description of how h ealth and elderly care is financed at regional 
and local level. It gives a brief  account of the annual financial agreements and a special funding system 
which provides financing for many social and healthcare -related projects.  
 
Throughout th e publication you will find a number of fact boxes describing specific areas such as cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, chronic diseases and dementia, as well as initiatives to improve healthcare, such 
as measures related to patient empowerment, the national quality progr amme, health promotion for children 
and prioritisation of hospital medicines.  
 
The publication includes a  number of figures and tables and a separate section with key indicators  on page 
52. A more detailed description of the agencies and authorities responsible for the Danish healthcare system 
can be found  on page 58 .

1. Organisation of Health and Elderly 
Care  
The healthcare system operates across 
three political and administrative levels: 
the state, the regions and  the 
municipalities (national,  regional and 
local levels).  
 
The state holds the overall regulatory 
and supervisory functions  in health and 
elderly care . The five regions are 
primarily responsible for the hospitals, 
the general practitioners (GPs) and for 
psychiatric care. The 98 munici palities 
are responsible for a number of primary 
healthcare services as well as for elderly 
care.  
The Ministry of Health  
The Ministry of Health is responsible for establishing the overall framework for the provision of health  and 
elderly care.  This includes legislation on the organisation and provision of health  and elderly care services , 
patients’ rights, health care professionals, hospitals and pharmacies, medicinal products, vaccinations, 
maternity care and child healthcare. The legislation c overs the tasks of the regions, municipalities and other 
authorities within the area of health.  
 
An organi sational chart of the Ministry of Health can be found on page 57 together with a brief description of 
each of the underlying agencies.  
 
The Regions  
The five regions are governed by regional councils, each composed of 41 members. The members are 
elected in regional elections  every four years.   
 
The regions are responsible for hospital care, including emergency care, psychiatry, and for health services 
provided by GPs and specialists in private practic e.

The regions organise health services for their citizens according to regional needs , and the individual region 
may adjust services within the fin ancial and national regulatory framework , enabling them to ensure the 
appropriate capacity. Moreover, the regions may refer patients to treatment abroad. In some cases the 
referral is subject to the approval of the Danish Health Authority.  
 
The Municipalities  
The 98 municipalities are local admi nistrative bodies governed by municipal councils . The council members 
are elected in municipal elections every four years.   
 
The municipalities are responsible for a number of health and social services.  Local health and elderly care 
services include  disease prevention and health promotion, rehabilitation outside hospital, home nursing, 
school health services, child dental treatment, child nursing, physiotherapy, alcohol and drug abuse 
treatment, home care services, nursing homes, and other services fo r elderly people.  In addition, 
municipalities co -finance regional rehabilitation services and training facilities.  
 
Financing  
In general, all health and social services are financed by general taxes and are supported by a system of 
central government block grants, reimbursements and equalization schemes.  
 
Approximately 84 per  cent of healthcare expenditure is publicly financed (2015). The remaining 16 per  cent 
are financed primarily through patient co-payments. Public expenditure on healthcare account s for 30 per  
cent of total public expenditures ( EUR 20.7 billion). In 2014, t he Danish health care expenditure amount ed to 
10.6 per  cent of GDP , which is more than the OECD average of 9.0 per  cent. 
 
Public expenditure on elderly care amounted to 2.8 per cent of  GDP in 2014 . This figure includes 
expenditures on services for disabled people and other citizens in need of care.

2. Patients’ Rights  
All residents in Denmark have access 
to the  public  healthcare system , and 
most services are provided free of 
charge. National legislation ensures 
that diagnosis and treatment are 
provided within certain time limits and 
establish es a free choice of hospital 
for patients. A comprehensive set of 
legal  rights governs  complaint 
procedures and compensation for 
injuries caused by  services provided in  
the healthcare system.  
 
The right to treatment, 
diagnosis and free choice of 
hospital  
Citizens in need of hospital care may, within certain limits, freely choose any public and some  private 
hospitals.  
  
If the region cannot ensure that treatment will be initiated within 30 days, patients have the right to a so -
called ‘extended free choice of hospital’. This means that patients may choose to go to a private hospital in 
Denmark or to a public or private hospital abroad.  
  
The regions are also required to ensure that any patient referred to a hospital is assessed with a view to 
diagnosis with in one month from the date of referral. If, for medical reasons, it is not possible to determine 
the condition of the patient within one month, the patient must receive a detailed plan to ensure further 
investigation of his/her health problem, including, f or example, further examinations at another hospital. If, for 
reasons of capacity, the region is not able to provide an assessment with a view to diagnosis within 30 days, 
the extended free choice of hospital applies, i.e. the patient may go to a private h ospital or a hospital abroad 
to be diagnosed.    
 
The right to  treatment, diagnosis and free choice of hospital applies to both mental and physical illness.  
 
Treatment abroad and reimbursement  
The regions may refer patients in need of highly speciali sed treatment to treatment abroad if the treatment is 
not available in Denmark. The referral is subject to the approval of the Danish Health Authority. The regions 
may also refer patients to receive research -related treatment abroad if relevant treatment is no t available in 
Denmark.  
  
8 
 The regions may also refer patients suffering from life -threatening diseases to receive experimental 
treatment in private hospitals in Denmark or abroad if public hospitals are unable to offer further treatment. 
The referral is sub ject to the approval of the Danish Health Authority.  
 
Denmark is a  Member of the European Union  and as such subject to the EU-Regulation on the coordination 
of social security systems1 and the directive on cross -border healthcare2.  The regulation lays dow n detailed 
rules on the coordination of health insurance for citizens travelling to or residing in EU/EEA Member States 
and Switzerland. Pursuant to the Directive , residents in Denmark have the right to reimbursement of the 
costs of healthcare provided in other EU/EEA Member States. This right covers both hospital treatment and 
treatment provided by GPs, medical specialists  in private practice , physiotherapists, chiropractors, dentists 
and other healthcare providers. In some cases, patients may need prio r authori sation from their home region 
before receiving the treatment abroad.  
 
Regional patient advisers, complaints and compensation  
The legal rights of patients are protected by a number of laws which aim to ensur e that patients receive the 
best possible care and regulat e complaint procedures and compensation for injuries caused by services 
provided in the healthcare system.  
 
Regional patient advisers have been established in each region to assist and guide patients in relation to 
diagnosis,  treatment, choice of hospital, waiting time, access to treatment abroad and the procedures for 
submit ting complaint s and receiv ing compensation. The assistance provided  by the patient advisers is free of 
charge and advisers work independently of the regio n and the staff at the hospital  in question . 
 
The Danish Patient Safety Authority serves as a single point of entry for all patients who wish to complain 
about health care professionals and/or treatment provided in the healthcare system (public and private) . The 
Danish Patient Safety Authority is also responsible for making sure that knowledge gained from patient 
complaints and compensation claims  is used preventively. Particularly serious cases may be submitted to 
the public prosecutor with a view to bringi ng the case before a court.  
 
The Disciplinary Board of the Danish Health care system  is an impartial public authority which may express 
criticism of healthcare professionals not acting in accordance with commonly agreed professional standards . 
 
Patients who  have sustained injuries caused by treatment in hospitals or by authori sed healthcare 
professionals  may be entitled to compensation , and patients can seek compensation by reporting injuries to 
the Danish Patient Compensation Association. The Danish Patient  Compensation Associa tion is responsible 
for applying  the legislation that deals with injuries occurring in connection with treatment in the public and 
private healthcare system.  
 
The Danish Patient Compensation Association may also award c ompensation in injuries related to 
pharmaceutical products, i.e. in cases where patients are injured because of side effects of medicines . 
Compensation is given for losses and expenses as a consequence of the injuries.

The regions cover the costs of compensation except for some treatments provided in the private healthcare 
system where the insurance company will pay. The Ministry of Health covers the costs of compensation in 
cases related to injuries caused by pharmaceuticals.    
 
If either the patient or the other party  in a case , i.e. the region, disagree with the decision made by the 
Danish Patient Compensation Association, they can appeal it to the Patient Compensation Appeals Board.  
 
If either the patient or the other party  in a case , i.e. the region, disagree with the decision made by the 
Patient Compensation Appeals Board, the case may be brought before a  court.  
 
It is free of charge for patients to seek compensation.  
 
Inspect ions and sanctions  
The Danish Patient Safety Authority supervises the activities carried out by healthcare professionals within 
the healthcare system . The authority makes inspection s based on general supervisory cases and current 
patient complaints submitted to  the independent Disciplinary board of  the Danish Healthcare System . If after 
an inspect ion the authority finds reason to criticise or sanction the actions and activities of healthcare 
professionals, the case is brought before the Disciplinary Board  of the  Danish Healthcare System . 
 
The Danish Patient Safety Board also follows up on organisational circumstances leading to adverse events 
to ensure that aspects of patient safety are considered and given priority by the hospital management.  If 
general safety issues  exposing pat ients to risks are identified, the Danish Patient Safety Authority has the 
legal capacity to issue instructions and guidelines for healthcare professionals.    
 
In 2017, the supervisory measures will shift to wards  a risk-based approach , implying that more resources will 
be allocated to those institutions and healthcare providers where patients are exposed to the highest risks in 
order to improve the quality of healthcare services in general.  
 
Efforts are currently being made to adjust the relevant system s in order to provide the necessary register 
date to support such a risk-based approach.  6,27,0 6,97,68,7 8,912,314,1 13,815,4

Adverse events  
Denmark was one of the first countries in the world to introduce a compulsory system for reporting adverse 
events in healthcare. This task was initiated in 2004 for public hospitals and was expanded to include 
primary healthcare services in the municipalities in 2010 . In 2011 , patients were given the opportunity to 
report adverse  events.  
 
Healthcare profession als are obliged to report adverse events, but also patients, nursing home residents and 
their relatives can submit reports. The reporting system is confidential  and non-punitive,  and report s can be 
submitted anonymously. The aim of th e system is to improve  patient safety through the monitoring , analysis 
and knowledge sharing of adverse events.   
 
The Danish Patient Safety Authority is responsible for the administration of the register of adverse events. 
After receiving the analysed and anonymi sed reports from the regions and municipalities, the Danish Patient 
Safety Authority look s for patterns and trends in selected areas and provide s feedback and  information  to the 
regions and municipalities regarding specific risk situations. The information is distribu ted in newsletters, 
alerts  and in reports on specific subjects. All publications are available on the website www.dpsd.dk .

Patient Empowerment through  
Involvement  
 
 
Patient Empowerment is about strengthening 
patients’ own resources and abilities with the aim 
of improving their capacity to develop, control and 
apply their own resources. The mapping of patient 
experiences also provides inputs to the work on 
quality impr ovement in the healthcare system.   
 
Every year, 250,000 patients are invited to 
participate in the National Survey of Patient 
Experience. The survey is conducted on behalf of 
the five regions and gives hospitals the 
opportunity to receive systematic feedb ack from 
their patients.  
 
The survey includes both inpatients and 
outpatients in hospitals and covers different 
aspects such as clinical services, patient safety, 
patient and staff member continuity, involvement 
and communication, information, discharge, inter-
sectorial cooperation, free hospital choice and 
waiting time.  
 
The overall objectives are:  
 
 to identify and compare the differences in 
patient experiences,  
 
 to provide input to quality improvements,  
 
 to follow the development of patient 
experiences and assessments 
systematically over time.  
 
The National Survey of Patient Experience 
consists of four studies focusing respectively on 
somatic hospitals, maternity rooms, emergency 
rooms and psychiatry.  
 
 
 
 National Survey Among Elderly People  
Every second year, a survey is conducted among 
elderly people (aged 67+) who receive either care 
in their own home or in a nursing facility.  
The survey includes questions on satisfaction with 
the quality of the services, satisfaction with the 
number of ca re workers, the stability of the help 
and whether citizens feel more self -sufficient after 
receiving help. The participants are also asked if 
they know about their right to choose between 
different service providers.   
 
IT-based self -service solutions  
eSundhed .dk:  
The webpage www.esundhed.dk provides citizens 
with information about the quality of healthcare 
services in order to enable patients to make an 
informed choice of hospital , see page 7. The 
webpage offers comprehensive information about 
the clinic al and organisational quality as well as 
studies of patient experience.  
 
Sundhed.dk:  
On this webpage, citizens can access a number of 
personal services and data such as patient 
records from hospitals (e -journals) as well as 
general information on health, diseases and 
patient rights.  
 
Patient reported outcome  
Patient reported outcome (PRO) is used as a 
common term for information about a patient’s 
health condition that is reported directly by the 
patient. As part of chemotherapy treatment, for 
example, a cancer patient will reply to a 
questionnaire about side effects of medicine or 
functional capacity.  
  
12 
  
Potentials for a more patient -centred  approach  
PRO has the potential to support a more patient -
centred approach to healthcare. The healthcare 
professio nal can use the patients’ replies to 
assess the need for a consultation or use it as an 
instrument for dialogue and decision making. PRO 
also has the potential to support patient -centred 
quality improvement and man agement.  
 
National initiatives to support the use of PRO  
The Danish government, regions and 
municipalities have agreed to support the use of PRO in daily clinical practice and in quality 
development. A new national working group will 
manage processes to harmonise PRO 
questionnaires and guidelines  for use as well as 
contribute to knowledge sharing about the use of 
PRO.  
 
The Danish government and regions have agreed 
to initiate nationwide spread of the use of PRO at 
hospitals towards 2019 within three disease 
areas: prostate cancer, breast cancer and 
epilepsy.   
13 
  
3. Primary Healthcare  
The primary healthcare system covers 
a number of health services as well as 
disease prevention and health 
promotion measures at local level. 
Primary healthcare services are 
provided by general practitioners 
(GPs), other private practicing 
healthcare profes sionals such as 
dentists, physiotherapists, and 
psychologists and by the municipalities 
which are responsible for home 
nursing, prevention measures and 
rehabilitation.  
 
 
Health insurance groups  
All citizens may choose between health insurance group s 1 or 2. Citizens who choose insurance group 1  are 
registered with a specific GP who is part of the public healthcare s ystem . Citizens in group 1 have the right to 
free medical assistance from the GP  and the right to free medical assistance from medical specialist s in 
private practice  if they have a referral from  their GP.  No referral is, however, needed for specialist treatment 
by certain specialists, such as ophthalmolo gists, otologists  and dentists.   
 
More than 99 per  cent of all patients are covered in group 1. Patients covered under health insurance group 
2 have the right to receive medical help from any GP and may visit medical specialists in private pract ice 
without referral, but services may be subject to co -paymen ts. 
 
The primary healthcare sector also includes services provided by a number of other health care professionals 
such as dentists, physiotherapists, and psychologists. Treatment by these specialists usually involves a co-
payment although public subsidies may be available under specific circumstances.  
 
General practitioners  
GPs fill a key position in the Danish healthcare system. The  GP is the patient ’s primary contact point to the 
healthcare system , and citizens contact their own GP with all questions related to health and illness. The 
GPs play an important role as gatekeepers between the primary level and the speciali sed healthcare system. 
When necessary, the GP will  refer patients to specialists, h ospital care or healthcare services provided by 
the municipalities, cf. Figure 3.   
14 
  
Figure 3 
Access structure of the Danish healthcare system  
 
Note: Not all specialist care, such  dental treatment , requires the referral from a general practitioner.  
 
 
This means that the GP is responsible for ensuring that patients are offered the best possible and most 
appropriate treatment. The GPs are assisted by diagnostic and specialist support from the hospitals in the 
form of laboratory analyses,  scan s and X -rays.   
 
Some  3,500 GPs are covered by the collective agreement with the public healthcare s ystem . Each GP has 
an average of 1,600 patients . Whereas e very citizen  is in contact with the primary healthcare system  seven 
times a year on average , 10 per cent of the population do not use the system within a year. The vast majority 
of medical cases are handled by the GPs without referral to further examination or specialised treatment.  
 
Many GPs are registered as sole practi tioners . However, during the last 20 years , it has become more 
common  for doctors  to share a medical practice with one or two other doctors .  
 
Home nursing  
Home nursing services are provided by the municipalities. All citizens are entitled to home nursing free of 
charge when prescribed by a medical doctor or on the basis of an assessment of an individual need.  
Moreover, the municipalities are required  to provide necessary aids and appliances free of charge. Home 
nurses provide treatment and care for people who are temporarily or chronically ill or dying.  
 
Home nursing enables citizens to stay in their home or close to home for as long as possible. Some 
municipalities have set up special units where citizens who do not require hospital isation  but are unable to 
stay i n their own home  can stay for shorter period s of time and receive intensive treatment and care from 
trained nurses.  
 
Rehabilitation  
The municipalities offer a comprehensive rehabilitation programme for all citizens in need. Rehabilitation 
includes physical  and mental training and other measures aimed at restoring both functional abilities as well 
as the general ability to take care of oneself, including patient education  and initiatives aimed at  general 
education and employment.  
 
 
15 
 The Danish Health Authorit y issues professional recommendations on training and rehabilitation for different 
patient groups and gives advice on the coordinati on of  rehabilitation efforts across sectors  to increase 
coherence and quality. Training and rehabilitation may commence at h ospitals , and patients discharged from 
hospital are offered a rehabilitation scheme when  necessary. Upon discharge, the hospital will send a 
rehabilitation plan , describing the functional level and rehabilitation needs of the patient , to both the 
municipality and the patient’s general practitioner, thus passing on the responsibility for rehabilitation and 
training schemes to the municipality.  
 
Training includes the training of bodily functions and training of activities designed to hel p patients regain 
former functional abilities . Rehabilitation also includes initiatives to help the patient become self -sufficient 
and able to manage everyday life. Patients with severe physical disability due to illness may receive training 
and treatment free of charge. Other services such as treatment by a chiropodist for patients suffering from 
diabetes, treatment by psychologists for particularly vulnerable groups, treatment at chiropractors and 
training supervised by physiotherapists, are partly covere d by the municipal ity if prescribed by the general 
practitioner.  
 
All patients who are temporarily or chronically ill or dying are entitled to home nursing when prescribed by a 
general practitioner , and the municipalities are required  to provide all neces sary aids and appliances free of 
charge.  
 
Vaccinations  
The national childhood immunisation programme provides a number of vaccines for children free of charge . 
Further information on the national childhood immunisation program me is found on page  28. 
 
The childhood immunization coverage against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Whooping Cough was at 90 p er cent 
or higher in 2015.  
 
Supplementary to the childhood immunisation programme, a number of other vaccinations are available to 
particular  risk groups. A compr ehensive immunisation programme  has been developed for people who suffer  
from or are at risk of contracting any form of hepatitis. Th ese include drug abusers, their relatives and all 
children in risk situations.   
 
Vaccination against influenza is offered to persons aged 65+ and person s with chronic diseases.  
 
All costs related to vaccinations included in national immunisation program mes are covered by the regions, 
while vaccinations related to private holidaying are at the citizen’s own expense .

 The Danish Healthcare Quality 
Programme  
 
 
 
 
In 2016, a new national healthcare quality 
programme was launched by the government 
together with the regions and the municipalities. 
The program me establishes a framework for 
continuousl y improving the quality of care in the 
healthcare system.   
 
Over the past 10 -15 years, the quality of care in 
Denmark has improved,  and the vision is to 
further enhance the quality of healthcare and to 
provide world -class treatment for each patient. 
Hence, the vision of the new quality programme is 
to provide even better quality for the individual 
patient but also to generate higher treatment 
stand ards in a more efficient way .  
 
The Danish Healthcare  Quality Programme 
introduces a new approach that puts even 
stronger emphasis on the expertise and skills of 
healthcare professionals and less emphasis on 
process -related registration requirements . In this 
way, the new Danish Healt hcare Q uality 
Programme is about cutting  red tape  as well.  
 
The Danish Healthcare Quality Programme thus 
represents a new and non -bureaucratic way of 
addressing quality in healthcare , serving as a 
driving force for regional and local quality 
improve ments.  
 
The programme is implemented through different 
initiatives. As a first step, Denmark has 
established a set of ambitious national goals for 
the quality of care. The national goals reflect the 
top political priorities in the healthcare system and 
will serve a governance tool to ensur e that all 
levels of the system – state, regions, 
municipal ities and GPs – will work towards the 
same goal of providing world -class healthcare.  
 
  
The national goals are supported by a number of 
local goals and activities aiming to achiev e local 
improvements across Denmark . The national 
goals will also make it easier to assess which 
areas are in need of improvements and identify 
efforts that make a p ositive difference for patients 
in the Danish healthcare sys tem.  
 
Besides the national goals, the Danish Healthcare 
Quality Program me presents the following 
initiatives:  
 Systematic consideration of the needs of 
the individual patient  
 
 Good management at all levels in the 
healthcare system  
 
 Learning teams that dissemin ate 
knowledge and best practice  
 
 Systematic use of data that creates 
visibility of results  
 
 Governance and incentives to support 
high treatment standards for the patient      
The Danish Healthcare Quality Programme is 
inspired by inputs from healthcare professionals 
and their organisations, patients and patient 
associations as well as  by successful approaches 
abroad. The framework will be further developed 
and implemented i n cooperation with all parts of 
the healthcare system including the regions, 
municipalities and patient associations. A 
pictogram of the national goals can be found on 
page 57.

4. Hospitals  
The regions are responsible for providing 
hospital treatment to the people living in 
the region and emergency treatment for 
all persons in need. Hospital care is free 
of charge for the patients.  
 
Almost 90 per  cent of all treatments 
provided in hospital are classified as 
standard hospital treatment s that are 
usually provided at a hospital in the 
patient’s own region . Only very few 
patients with general complaints are 
referred to other regions.  
 
Specialised hospital treatment accounts for about 10 per cent of all hospital services and includes highly 
specialised services ( one to three  hospitals in the country) and regional functions ( one to three  hospitals in 
each region). The definition of specialised services is based on an assessment of the size of the patient 
group as well as the complexity and cost of the service.   
 
The hospital sector is currently undergoing a complete restructuring. An important part of this transformation 
is the merging of specialised functions into fewer and larger units. The mode rnisation of the hospital capacity 
is based  on sustained specialisation and flexibility  with the aim of ensur ing nationwide access to modern 
health service s and to  improve quality of care not only in standard hospital treatment but also in specialised 
services.   
 
Planning of specialised hospitals  
While the regions are responsible for the planning of standard hospital services, the Danish Health Authority 
is responsible for planning the overall distribution of specialised  hospital services. The Danish Health 
Authority defines and allocates specialist functions among  hospitals in close cooperation with medical 
associations and the regions. The purpose of this centrali sed planning process is to improve and ensure 
quality and continuity of care, while at t he same time ensuring efficient use of resources.  
 
The specialised regional functions are, depending on the speciality, distributed among  one to three  hospitals 
per region, while highly  specialised services are located in one to three hospitals in the country. Private 
hospitals are covered to some extent, in particular those private hospitals which handle specialist functions 
and which have made agreement s with one or more regions to provide services  in case of capacity problems 
at the public hospitals.     
18 
 New hospitals and sustained hospital services structure  
Denmark is investing EUR 6.4 billion in 16 new hospital projects. These projects include greenfield projects 
as well as extensions and modernisations of existing hospitals, cf. Figure 4. The goal is to ensure national 
access to modern health services and to improve quality across the entire healthcare system. Designing the 
new hospitals involves broad -based collaboration with research institutions and private businesses in th e 
field of health.   
 
The process of modernising Denmark’s future hospital capacity is based on sustained specialisation and 
flexibility. The goal is to ensure flexible functions and capacity that can be adjusted , expanded or reduced 
depending on future dem and for treatment and care.  
 
The new hospitals will provide better and more coherent patient flows and contribute to improved efficiency, 
quality of care and patient safety.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pre-hospital care  
and ambulance services  
Emergencies are reported on telephone number 112 throughout Denmark . Calls are received by the 
police and forwarded to a health care professional, who will decide if ambulance services and other pre -
hospital care are needed.  
 
The dispatcher at the emergenc y call centre can send paramedics, medical doctors or specialised 
nurses by car to help at the scene together with the ambulance service. The dispatcher can also send a 
helicopter manned with doctors to arrive quickly at  the scene of an accident , who can b egin stabilising 
and life -saving treatment and ensure fast  transport of the patient to a hospital.  
 
The regions are responsible for offering pre -hospital care and ambulance service free of charge for the 
patient.  
  
Most regions fulfil the obligation of of fering ambulance service s by using private contractors or local fire  
brigades.  
 
The structure of the pre -hospital care and ambulance services is an example of the successful 
cooperation with private contractors within the Danish healthcare system.  
  
19 
 The construction of the new hospitals requires new technologies and solutions to ensure cost -effective care 
and shorter average admission times. At the same time, ICT  (information and communications technology)  
infrastructure will be a major factor in the development of communication.  
 
 
Figure 4 
The new hospital landscape  
 
Source: Danish Regions  
 
Out of the total budget for new hospitals, EUR 0.9 billion has been earmarked for the procurement of medical 
equipment and information technology. These investments will broaden the basis for scientific research at 
most hospitals. Concentrating specialist medical care and enhanced research facilities a t the new hospitals 
will hold opportunities for more wide -ranging collaboration with other research environments, including 
business and industry.  
 
Furthermore, the investments will strengthen the collection of health data and contribute to the quality of  
research and development and the documentation of new products.  
 
The modernised hospital infrastructure is expected to  contribute significantly to wards  the vision of placing  
Denmark among the most attractive countries in the world for developing, testing  and manufacturing 
healthcare solutions based on strong research, fast implementation of innovative new technology, good 
conditions for public -private collaboration and a well -functioning, development -oriented home market.  
 
As a result of the modernisatio n process, the number of bed days is expected to be reduced by 20 per  cent, 
and outpatient treatment to be expanded by 50 per  cent from 2007 to 2020.  
 
  
 
20 
 Emergency healthcare services  
The aim of the emergency standby system is to ensure safe and fast treatment for people who are injured or 
have suddenly become seriously ill.  
 
Emergency healthcare services play a crucial role in the moderni sation of the Danish hospital structure. 40 
emer gency departments have been  merged into 21 larger units. Emergency car e is provided by paramedics, 
nurses and doctors  on the scene , in ambulances or in specially equipped helicopters. Treatment continues at 
one of the 21 emergency standby departments established at hospitals and staffed with specialists on a 24 -
hour basis in order to ensure that all patients receive appropriate treatment in case of sudden injury or 
illness.  
 
Additionally, a number of smaller emergency cli nics have been established for patients who are not in need 
of hospital treatment.  
  
21 
  
5. Elderly Care 
The Danish p eople are generally healthy 
and live longer than previous generations. 
We expect the number of people over 65 
years to grow significantly , and it is 
estimated that by 2040  there will be twice 
as many people aged 80 or over than 
there is today.  
 
Danish senior -citizen policy aims at 
promoting and extending the 
independency of elderly people and 
ensuring their continued self-sufficiency 
and w ell-being . Local authorities achieve 
this goal through prevention and 
reablement program mes and by providing adequate home care services and nursing facilities free of charge 
for all citizens in need.  
 
Organi sing elderly care 
Social services for elderly citizens are provided mainly by the 98 municipalities , that  are fully  responsib le for 
public governance, provision, delivery and financing of elderly care in Denmark. While t he Social Service Act 
constitutes the framework for the services provided by municipalities and their obligations within the en tire 
area of social services, the extended self -rule principle for local government in Denmark means that the 
municipalities  decide on the specific metho ds and service levels  they wish to apply . The municipal council 
must ensure that services are always provided on the basis of an assessment of individual needs.  
 
In order to promote user influence, all municipalities must e stablish Senior Citizens’ Councils. These councils 
are elec ted for four-year terms , and all citizens over 60 have the right to vote or run for the council. The 
municipality must consult the Senior Citizens Council in any issue relevant to the elderly population in the 
municipality.  
 
Home care services  
Home care services are targeted at elderly people who live at home but are unable to manage everyday life 
on their own . Home care falls in  two categories : practical help (e.g. cleaning and laundering) and personal 
care (e.g. bathing and shaving). The munic ipality provides these services free of charge. Elderly people may 
also receive food services based on an assessment of individual need. In 2015, a round 12 per  cent of all 
elderly over 65 receive d home care services.  
 
Elderly people pay for food services , but a maximum limit for co -payment has been set at national level and 
the cost cannot exceed average production cost.  
  
22 
 The principle of free choice is fundamental to Danish elderly care. The municipality must provide a choice 
between different service providers of home care and food services. The local authorities are under the 
obligation to ensure that there are at least two providers of home care services, of which one can be a public 
provider.  
 
Reablement  
Another f undamental principle of home care services is self -reliance. Home care services are always offered 
after a thorough assessment of individual needs and with the specific aim of restoring, maintaining and 
improving mental and physical functionality.  
 
The tr aditional home care services  mentioned above are combined with a strong emphasis  on rehabilitation 
and reablement.  
 
Municipalities are required by law to assess if a person in need of home care services could benefit from a 
reablement scheme in the form of a specific training  programme aiming at regaining physical or social 
functionality and achieving better quality of life. Every re ablement scheme must be limited in time and 
adjusted to the individual needs and capabilities of the elderly.  
 
Nursing homes and home nursing  
Nursing homes are for elderly people who no longer have full physical or mental functionality and need 
special and extensive care. Nursing home facilities are staffed 24 hours a day by healthcare professional s.  
 
It is the responsibility of the municipalities to evaluate if a citizen should  be offered to move in to a nursing 
home. Residents pay individually for their residential facilities, food and private expenses whereas  nursing 
and health care services are free of charge.  
 
The waiting time for a  standard place in a nursing home must not exceed two months from the time of 
referral. However, if the elderly person wants to live in a specific nurs ing home or move to another 
municipality, a maximum waiting time cannot be guarant eed.  
 
In 2015, a pproximately 4 per cent of elderly people over 65 years lived in nursing homes in Denmark . 
 
Some nursing homes have facilities for residents staying for shorter period s of time during rehabilitation.  
 
All citizens are also entitled to home nursing free of charge  when prescribed by a medical doctor  or on the 
basis of an assessment of an individual need .  
 
Preventive measures and home visits  
The m unicipalities are responsible for initiating preventive measures to help people manag e their own li ves 
for as long as possible. This includes community based social activities, physical training facilities, 
organisation of volunteer services and other preventive efforts.  
  
Home visits are a specific preventive effort , aiming to  identify the need for individual assistance and discuss 
the wellbeing and current life situation of the elderly person. Preventive home visits must be offered to 
vulnerable and socially exposed people aged between 65 and 79 when ever needed and to all elde rly 
persons over 80 years on a yearly basis.  
   
23 
 New national action plan for the 
elderly medical patient  
 
In the Finance Act for 2016, the government has prioritised an annual allocation of EUR 40.2 million to 
a new national action plan for the elderly medical patient.  
The elderly medical patient often suffers from severe disease, several simultaneous diseases and/or 
impaired functional abilities. As a result, the elderly medical patient is in frequent contact with the GP, 
the hospital and the municipali ty.  
The national action plan for the elderly medical patient focuses primarily on efforts before and after 
hospitalisation and on increased coherence across sectors. For instance the plan outlines initiatives to 
improve the ability of the municipalities t o detect early signs of disease, loss of functional ability etc. in 
order to prevent unnecessary hospitalisation of elderly people and initiatives to support more flexible 
use of competences across sectors.    
The new national action plan also includes a pl an for immediate action against hospital overcrowding 
that provides methods and tools to ensure better use of hospital capacity across departments.  
Analysis  show s that almost fifty per cent of the patients on medical wards are over 65 years. Many of 
the e lderly people who are hospitalised suffer from a chronic disease or dementia. Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most frequent diseases among elderly patients on medical 
wards. A minor percentage of the elderly have two or more chro nic diseases.   
24 
  
Dementia  
 
 
 
Dementia is a growing challenge for society. In 
2014 more than 35,100 people over 65 years had 
a dementia diagnosis, but the number of people 
living with dementia today may be considerably 
higher.  
 
The Danish Dementia Research Centre estimates 
that the actual number of people with dementia in 
Denmark is around 80,000*.  
 
The increasing number of people suffering from 
dementia is a challenge for society and calls for a 
more comprehensive and coherent coop eration 
between social and health sectors. The Danish 
government is currently working on a new national 
action plan for dementia, involving both citizens 
living with dementia, relatives, professionals in the 
field, organisations and others who can contribu te 
with their knowledge and expe rience.  
 
The action plan will include a number of specific 
initiatives and inter -sectorial efforts that will benefit 
people with dementia. The plan is expected to 
cover areas such as early detection and better 
diagnosis as tools to ensure appropriate treatment   
 
and care for people with dementia as well as 
support and counselling for their relatives.  
The plan will also address suitable housing design 
as well as the development of adequate 
professional skills and rese arch i n the field of 
dementia.  
 
The action plan for dementia will be based on the 
following three overall objectives:  
 Denmark must be a dementia friendly 
country where people with dementia can 
live a dignified and safe life.  
 
 Treatment and care of people with 
dementia must be based on the needs 
and values of the individual patient. 
Treatment and care must be provided in a 
coherent way that ensures early 
intervention and must be based on the 
newest knowledge and research.  
 
 Relatives must be ac tively involved  and 
receive adequate support. 
 
 
 
 
*The difference between the number of people diagnosed with dementia and the estimated number of 
people with dementia is caused by various factors. For one thing, many people with symptoms of dementia 
do not contact their GP. For another, many patients are diagnosed in the primary healthcare sector and thus 
are not registered in a central register.  
    
25 
  
6. Psychiatric Care  
In recent years, psychiatric care in 
Denmark has undergone significant 
development. The number of patients 
has grown , and treatment methods 
have change d considerably , both with 
regard to the face -to-face contact  with 
patients and with regard to an increase 
in outpatient treatment and a 
subsequent reduction in the number of 
hospital beds.  
 
Between 2009 and 2014 , the number of 
patients in contact with psychiatric 
hospital services increased by 28 per  
cent. This increase is partly due to a more open approach to people with psychiatric problems and partly due 
to a wider definition of psychiatric diagnos es requir ing professional treatment. One example is the growing 
number of adults with ADHD. In the same period , the number of patients in outpatient care increased by 31  
per cent, while the number of inpatients increa sed by only 5 per  cent.  
 
The overall responsibility for the provision of psychiatric care lies with the regions and the municipalities. The 
regions are responsible for psychiatric hospital services as well as for local psychiatry centres . The 
municipaliti es are responsible for the provision of social services and for alcohol and drug abuse treatment. 
Local psychiatry centres are open for all people with psychiatric problems and provide outpatient treatment 
and extensive support during crisis situations. Pa tients are not admitted into a psychiatric ward as such, but 
may stay in the local psychiatry centre until they feel better or until they have been diagnosed with a 
psychiatric condition. Also, patients who have been discharged from a psychiatric hospital can benefit from 
the care and support at a local psychiatry centre.  
 
A new direction for psychiatric care  
A number of initiatives have been taken to improve the conditions for psychiatric patients.  
 
In 2012 , a committee was set up with the aim to develop proposals on how to organi se psychiatric care and 
achieve the best possible results through cost -effective measures . 
  
The committee developed 90 recommendations within six areas:  
 
 Prevention and early intervention  
 Stronger coherence and continuity of care 
 Quality of care   
 Involvement of citizens, relatives and civil society   
26 
  Reduction in the use of coercion  
 Cost-effective use of resources and better management.  
 
The report emphasi sed the need to ensure equal status and equal rights  for people suffering from mental 
illness . The individual patient and his or her possibility of recovery should be the starting point of all 
treatment , and treatment should , to the extent possible , be provided in the local environment to enable 
patients to  carry on everyday life.  
 
To pursue this new direction, significant resources have been allocated to the field of psychiatric care with 
the aim of achiev ing: 
  
 more high-quality capacity  
 improved skills in psychiatric care  
 modern psychiatric care with better physical facilities and environments  
 inter-disciplinary efforts in child and adolescent  psychiatry.  
 
The use of coercion  
Besides the emphasis on community based care, it was also considered imperative to ensure that people 
dealing with a psychiatric  illness uphold equal rights and equal status with regard to personal self -
determination compared to patients  with physical illness . In June 2014, a political agreement was made to 
reduce the use of coercive measures in psychiatric treatment by 50 per  cent in 2020 , and a task force was 
set up to monitor  progress .   
 
 
Figure 5

In May 2015, the Danish Mental Health Act was amended with the aim of improving treatment for people with 
mental illness and ensuring a reduction in the use of coercive measures. In order to ensure quality in the use 
of necessary coercive measures  and limit the duration of physical restraints , the new rules stipulate a 
minimum frequency of medical supervision and continuous assessment of whether restraint should cease or 
continue. Furthermore, the amendment states that belt restraint must only be used for short period s of time.  
 
In order to reduce the overall use of coercion, it is of major importance to expand the capacity in psychiatric 
care but also to provide better physical environments and more appropriate facilities that will reduce 
externalising and violent behaviour among patients. The new psychiatric hospital in Slagelse is a good 
example of how alternative measures  for restless patients may help reduc e the use of coercive measures.  0246810

 Psychiatry and drug abuse  
 
In 2014, an initiative was launched to improve coordination of measures aimed at citizens with both mental 
illness and drug and/or alcohol  abuse . This initiative provides guidelines for regions and municipalities , which  
are required to coordinate healthcare and social efforts in order to ensure a coherent and integrated 
treatment plan with joint and clearly defined responsibilities.  
 
Regarding other policies related to mental health please see page  33.  
 
 
 
 
New psychiatric hospital in 
Slagelse  
A new way of thinking psychiatric care  
In august 2015, a new psychiatr ic hospital opened in the city of  Slagelse located in Region Zealand. 
With its 44,000 m2 and 194 beds, the hospital features new technology, innovative architecture and 
extensive use of nature and light, which altogether represent a new way of thinking psychiatric care.  
 
Innovative techn ology, nature and warm surroundings  
The architectural composition of the buildings with many roof windows and glass facades allows 
daylight and views to natural landscape gardens from all rooms. Smaller gardens create space for 
social activities in small u nits, and the facilities also include a wellness area and spa and a variety of 
sports and exercise equipment that can be used by both patients and relatives.  
The hospital uses an advanced and unique lighting system, as several studies have shown that light  is 
an important element in treatment, leading to shorter admission times and faster recovery. Patients 
benefit from an intelligent LED lighting system, providing blue -white light in the morning and reddish 
light in the afternoon and evening to support a n atural day -night cycle.  
The hospital also has a special multi -stimuli room in which different light settings, music, natural 
sounds and pictures of nature can be used to calm down troubled and unrestful patients by giving 
them appropriate stimuli, instead  of isolating patients and removing all stimuli.  
Reducing use of coercion  
The vision is that all these elements will benefit the treatment of patients in general and reduce 
medication. However, the main purpose is to reduce the use of coercion by providin g pleasant 
surroundings and focusing on light, extra space, physical exercise, meaningful acti vities and multi -
stimuli rooms.

Health Promotion for Children  
 
 
All children have the right to preventive health 
examinations at the GP and health services from 
the municipal ities, includ ing child nursing, school 
nursing and den tal care.   
The municipalities are responsible for providing 
preventive healthcare to all children.  
The municipality offers at least five health visits by 
a nurse (healt h visitor) to all families during the 
child’s first year of life with the aim of supporting 
early bonding between the child and parents and 
supporting the child’s general wellbeing and 
development . Also, the general practitioner carries 
out seven  scheduled  preventive health 
examinations of pre -school children in connection 
with the Danish  childhood immunisation  
program me. 
All school children are offered preventive health 
examinations by a doctor or  school nurse when 
starting school at the age of 6 and before leaving 
secondary school. There are also frequent 
examinations to check eye sight, hearing, height 
and weight , and children with special needs are 
offered further examinations, guidance and 
assistance.  
Dental healthcare  
All children and adole scents under the age of 18 
have the right to free preventive dental care 
treatment. This service is provided by public 
dental clinics or by p ractising dentists, who have 
an agreement with the municipality.  Adolescents 
aged 16 and 17 may also choose to atte nd a 
private practising dentist without agreement with 
the municipality.   
However, as the level of subsidy for treatment at a 
private dentist must be approved by the 
municipality , the adolescent may have to pay up 
to 35 per  cent of the cost him - or herself . 
Vaccinations  
All children are included in the Danish childhood 
immunisation  program me and can be vaccinated 
against pneumococcal disease (PCV  7), 
whooping cough  (pertussis) , diphtheria, tetanus, 
polio, measles, German measles, mumps and 
Haemophilus influenza type B. It is also 
recommended that all girls are vaccinated against 
cervical cancer  at the age of 12, but  the HPV 
vaccine  may also be given later.  
Children in day care  institutions with another child 
infected with chronic hepatitis B may be 
vaccinated against hepatitis B upon 
recommendation by the Danish Patient Safety 
Authority. Children under 18 may also be 
vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if they live 
close ly to hepatitis B infected people upon 
recommendation.  
Contraceptives  
The GP offers  free guidance on the use of 
contraceptives. Guidance may be offered to 
children and young people under 18 without 
parental consent. All children receive 
comprehensive sexuality education in school.

7. Health Promotion  
Public health reflects both the lifestyle of 
the citizens and the ability of the 
healthcare system to prevent, treat and 
cure diseases. The general social and 
living conditions, such as education, 
income, housing conditions, work 
environment and the organi sation of the 
healthcare system, all play an important 
role in ensuring a healthy life. Other 
important factors are gender, age and 
hereditary factors.  
 
Life expectancy in Denmark has 
increased from 77.9 years in 2005 to 80.6 
years in 2015. Danish women h ave a 
higher life expectancy (82.5 years in 2015) than Danish men (78.6 years in 2015).  
 
But even though life expectancy in Denmark has increased, the Danes  do not live  as long as c itizens in  
some European countries . This is mainly due to lifestyle factors , such as overweight, physical inactivity, 
smoking and alcohol consumption.  
 
In Denmark, the health and wellbeing of all citizens are considered to be a common concern for the 
individual, the family and local network, the local community, the municipalities, the regions and the state. 
The state lays down the overall framework  to enable people to live a healthy life , and the municipalities are 
responsible for ensuring that the local community provides healthy environments as well as health -promo ting 
and disease -preven ting activities and facilities.  
 
The specific health -promoting efforts at local level are not defined by law. The efforts of individual 
municipalities depend on the health conditions of the local population and on local priorities. T he 
municipalities are also given economic incentives to implement effective prevention and health -promoting 
efforts as they co -finance hospital treatment as well as treatment by the GPs.  
 
Health promotion packages  
The Danish Health Authority is responsible  for conveying information to the population and to the authorities 
on the health status of the Danish population, health -related risk factors and the prevention of unhealthy 
lifestyles.

To this end, the Danish Health Authority has developed  detailed teaching material, launched information 
campaigns and provided technical guidance regarding a number of risk factors. 11 so-called ‘ health 
promotion packages ’ were published in 2012 and 2013 to assist decision -makers and health care 
professionals in setting priorities when planning and organising health -promotion  efforts at local level . The 
packages all contain recommendations based on scientific knowledge to support the preventive work of the 
municipalities . The implementation of the packages is s upported by the Centre for Practical Prevention 
established by Local Government Denmark, the national association of municipalities.   
 
Each health promotion package includes  basic level recommendations and performance indicators for four 
action areas :  
 
 Framework (plans and policies at municipal level)  
 Initiatives (counselling, training, treatment)  
 Information and education (information, marketing of  local preventive services , support of 
national/central initiatives)  
 Early detection (screening and early de tection of risk factors)  
 
The health promotion packages cover 11 focus areas: alcohol, tobacco, physical activity, mental health, 
sexual health, sun protection, indoor climate in schools, hygiene, healthy food and meals, obesity and drug 
abuse.  
 
31 
 Alcohol  
Municipalities are required to offer free treatment to citizens with alcohol abuse within 14 days. Many private 
organi sations also work on a voluntary basis to combat alcohol abuse, often in close cooperation with public 
authorities.  
 
National measures to combat alcohol abuse include legislation that prohibits the sale of alcoholic drinks to 
persons under the age of 16 and the sale of alcoholic beverages containing more than 16.5 per  cent alcohol 
to persons under the age of 18. Measures also include camp aigns to reduce weekly consumption to no more 
than 14 units of alcohol for men and 7 units for women. The latest campaign focused on the harmful effects 
of binge drinking.  
 
Smoking and tobacco   
Prevention of smoking and tobacco use has been given high priority in Denmark during the last 25 years, 
resulting in a decrease in the proportion of daily smokers among adults (age 15+) from 44 per  cent in 1990 to 
17 per  cent in 2015. 22 per  cent of all adults smoke occasionally.  
 
According to the Smoke -free Envi ronment Act, people in Denmark are not allowed to smoke in public and 
private workplaces, institutions for children and adolescents, educational institutions, indoor facilities 
accessible by the public, including means of public transport and in restaurant s, bars, cafes and other places 
of entertainment.  
 
Other efforts to reduce smoking and tobacco use include prevention activities aimed at combatting smoking 
among young people and smoking cessation courses for heavy smokers. A number of public campaigns 
have been launched to encourage smoking cessation and most municipalities have established local clinics 
that offer free smoking cessation program mes. 
 
The sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 18 is prohibited. Customs duty on tobacco 
produc ts is relatively high in Denmark , and pictorial warnings on the health hazards of smoking have been 
introduced on cigarettes and other tobacco products. Tobacco advertising is prohibited.  
 
In spring 2016 , the Danish government presented an act to regulat e electronic cigarettes. According to the 
act it is illegal to sell electronic cigarettes (with or without nicotine) to people younger than 18 years and to 
advertise electronic cigarettes (with or without nicotine).  
 
Drugs  
The Danish prevention program me on drug abuse is based on inter -sectorial efforts of both social care and 
healthcare professionals. It includes collaboration between local and regional authorities, the central 
healthcare, social and judiciary systems as well as the central customs authori ties. The Ministry of Health 
coordinates and is responsible for the national drug prevention program me, which is administered by the 
Danish Health Authority.  
 
The Danish Health Authority monitors drug abuse and ensures that new trends and risks are identified and 
communicated to other authorities. The Danish Health Authority is responsible for the prevention of drug  
abuse at national level, the development of information and education material and nationwide prevention 
program mes.  
  
32 
 As of 1 Mar ch 2009, treatment with medically prescribed heroin for injection has been allowed in Denmark. 
Five clinics have been established nationwide to contribute to preventive efforts aimed at reducing the 
deterioration of the patients’ health and to qualify and increase knowledge o n how to improve the quality of 
life for drug abusers in terms of health and social integration.  
 
In 2012, it was also made possible to establish and run special premises where  drug users over the age of 
18 are allowed to take their  drugs in hygienic settings and under the supervision of qualified p rofessionals , 
trained to intervene in the case of overdoses.  
 
Nutrition and obesity  
The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly in Denmark over the last few decades.  
The percentage of overweight people has increased from 31 per cent in 1987 to 47  per cent in 201 3.  
 
The objective of nutrition policy  in Denmark  is to encourage the population to opt for a diet that promotes 
health and prevents illness. The highest priority is to reduce the amount of fat consumed by the population 
and to promote the intake of food s rich in complex carbohydrates and fibres, both ha ving a significant impact 
on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. It is especially important to ensure 
healthy diets for children, young people and the elderl y.  
 
Information campaigns as well as legislation in areas such as taxation and food labelling are important tools 
in achieving these objectives. In addition, great efforts are made to highlight the importance of nutrition 
schemes in public institutions, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and child care institutions. The Ministry of 
Environment and Food is responsible for policies related to food and nutrition.  
 
Physical activity  
Research shows that physical activity can prolong life, diminish the risk of ill ness  and prevent an early death. 
The municipalities are responsible for prevention measures related to physical activ ity. The Danish Health 
Authority contributes by generating awareness and knowledge about the advantages of  physical activity  
through national c ampaigns. According to the national recommendations , children should be physically 
active for at least 60 minut es every day and adults for at least 30 minutes every day.  
 
The term physical activity includes all kinds of movement that increases energy excha nge and covers both 
exercise and sports games, as well as daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs or cleaning.  
 
Local involvement by the municipality and local sports clubs are crucial for the success of preventive 
initiatives concerning physical activity, as most of the practical preventive work must be initiated and carried 
out in the local community where people live. For children, the public school reform in 2014 introduced an 
obligation to ensure 45 minutes of daily movement in schools to promote physical activity among children.  
 
Mental health  
During one year, 20 per  cent of the Danish population will experience problems with their mental health , and 
awareness of the need to promote mental health has increased in Denmark in recent years. Especially the 
municipalities are working to promote mental health and have established cross -sectorial collaborations in  
this field. Also a number of private stakeholders have taken an in terest in mental health and are offering 
activities for the promotion of health and wellbeing focusing on different target groups.  
  
33 
 The general approach in Denmark is for mental health  efforts to be designed and carried out within the local 
settings where people live their daily lives – includ ing famil y, day care  centres , schools and work places.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mental h ealth  
 
Promotion package   
The Danish Health Authority has developed a health promotion package on mental health.  
The objective is to support local efforts to promote citizens’ mental health and to strengthen local 
prevention efforts.  
The promotion package on mental health has been well accepted and widely implemented over the last 
years and has pushed mental health up on the local  political agenda.  
 
Cross -sectorial collaborations  
Currently, there is increased emphasis on the establishment of cross -sectorial collaborations  
for the promotion of mental health. The Danish government, the municipalities and the private 
stakeholders ru n initiatives that promote the concept of ‘inclusion’. For example, in primary care settings 
and schools, early interventions are introduced to promote equity and combat stigma regarding mental 
health and mental illnesses.  
  
Mental health at workplaces   
The Ministry of Health has initiated a public -private partnership on mental health in the workplace. The 
aim is to establish binding cooperation between labour market organisations, municipalities and the 
regions. The focus is on small and medium -sized compa nies within the public and private sector.   
34 
  
Chronic Diseases  
 
 
 
Around one million Danish people suffer from one 
or multiple chronic diseases. The government has 
allocated EUR 160 million in 2016 -2019 to 
strengthen the efforts for patients with chronic 
diseases.  
 
Approximately one million Danes suffer from one 
or more chronic diseases such as diabetes, 
arthritis or lung disease – a number that is 
expected to increase. At the same time, people 
live longer wit h their disease today tha n the  
previous generations. This means that healthcare 
expenditure on chronically ill patients is 
increasing.  
 
Diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are two of the most common 
chronic diseases in Denmark: Around 215,000 
persons (4.8 per  cent of the population) live with 
type 2 diabetes and  around 170,000 live with 
COPD.  
 
To overcome these challenges, close cooperation 
between the different units and actors within the 
healthcare system is needed in order to ensure 
early detection, diagnosis and adequate treatment 
for the individual patient. The government has 
prioriti sed EUR 160 million in 2016 -2019 to strengthen the efforts for patients with diabetes, 
COPD, arthritis and other chronic diseases.  
 
The aim is to detect the disease an d to begin 
treatment as early as possible and to ensure that 
all patients receive comprehensive high -quality 
treatment regardless of where they live. To this 
end, it has been decided to strengthen the effort s 
for chronic diseases by developing individual 
action plans for all patients with COPD, diabetes 
and arthritis.  
 
The action plan s aim to ensure that each patient 
becomes  fully aware of what to expect after the 
diagnosis, but also to promote patient 
empowerment and active participation in the 
treatment and management of the dis ease.  
 
Furthermore, the government has presented an 
action plan for lung diseases to strengthen early 
detection of COPD and child hood  asthma. This 
plan also includes supplementary and ongoing 
education for GPs and the expansion of national 
telemedicine projects for COPD patients.  
  
35 
  
National Strategy for Personalised 
Medicine   
 
 
Around the world we currently see important new 
developments, where new technologies and 
molecular knowledge – e.g. about genetics – are 
increasingly used to provide patients with better 
and more targeted healthcare (Personalised 
Medicine).  
 
In Denmark, m any hospital departments apply or 
are planning to apply genome sequencing 
techniques, and a majority of medical specialties 
expect to start using genome sequencing in the 
nearest future. There are already good examples 
within cancer care, but the technique  has great 
potential within many disease areas.  
 
Many universities and hospitals are conducting 
research in the area, and research takes place in 
all stages of the value chain – from basic genome 
research to research in clinical practice. It is 
estimated t hat more than approximately EUR 70 
million. Euro  have been invested in research 
infrastructure of relevance to Personalised 
Medicine in recent years, e.g. in biobanks, 
genome sequencing equipment and 
supercomputers capable of processing large 
volumes of ge netic information.  
 
To ensure coordination and direction for the 
collective efforts in this field, the Danish 
Government and Danish Regions have developed 
a National Strategy for Personalised Medicine 2017 -2020. The strategy includes the formation of 
a Nat ional Genome Centre  
 
Overall, the focus of the strategy is to:  
 
Establish a foundation for the development of 
better and more targeted healthcare for patients, 
through application of new technologies and new 
knowledge.  
 
Strengthen the ethical, legal and s afety aspects 
related to the use of genetic information in 
healthcare.  
 
Establish a joint governance structure and 
strengthen collaborations across the country – 
both in healthcare and research.  
 
Establish a cooperation about a safe, joint and 
coherent t echnological infrastructure.  
 
Initiate relevant research – and development 
projects.  
 
The National Budget has allocated approximately 
EUR 13. 5 million in 2017 -2020 to initiate this 
project and future expansion of Personalised 
Medicine is  expected to be c o-financed by public 
research resources, regional healthcare resources 
and private actors.  
 
   
36 
  
8. Digiti sation and Health Data  
The Danish healthcare system is 
characterised by extensive digitisation, 
electronic communication between 
healthcare providers and systematic use 
of data and digitised working procedures.  
 
Public hospitals and general practitioners 
(GPs) systematically co llect data, and 
their contact with the patient is sustained 
over long periods of time. This permits 
large -scale monitoring and analysis, while 
records in the national patient register 
and medication databases permit a 
significant degree of, for example, pa tient-
compliance monitoring.  
 
The prevalence of common IT standards facilitates electronic communication between healthcare providers – 
hospitals, GPs, specialists, laboratories , local authorities, home care services and others:  
 
 All GPs keep electronic health records (EHRs) , and 98 per  cent exchange records electronically . 
 GPs receive all laboratory test results from the hospitals electronically . 
 99 per  cent of all prescriptions are sent electronically to the pharmacies .  
 97 per  cent of all referrals to hospitals are made electronically . 
 All referrals to medical specialists and psychologists are made electronically.  
 
Information and communications technology (ICT) and digital workflows are fully integrated in the healthcare 
system. According to the benchmarking information of the European Commission and the OECD, EU’s e -
health deployment indicator, Denmark ranks as one  of the front -runners in the deployment of e -health.  
 
Extensive digitisation – electronic communication between health service partners  
Denmark has a long tradition for thorough monitoring and registration of patients who are in contact with the 
healthca re system. Extensive digitisation enables the  monitoring of patients and the course of their disease 
over time.  
 
The following IT solutions have been significant in Denmark and have also won international acclaim:  
  
37 
  Implementation of the so -called MedCom3 standards that have digitised much of the communication 
within the health system.  
 Establishment of the health data network for secure electronic communication between all 
healthcare providers.  
 The web portal Sundhed.dk where citizens have access to their own medical data from national 
health registers, electronic health records (EHR), medication data etc. These data can also be 
accessed by the patient’s GP.  
 The Shared Medication Record which gives citizens and healthcare professionals access to a 
complete electronic record of each citizen’s current prescription  medications. The Shared Medication 
Record  system simplifies communication concerning medication between healthcare providers and 
reduces the risk of giving inappropriate medication. The Shared Medication Record is almost fully 
implemented at hospitals, general practitioners and local health authorities (e.g. municipal nursing 
homes).  
 
Across the healthcare system, work is currently in progress to link the var ious IT solutions more seamlessly 
so that existing patient data can be accessed by different healthcare professionals and care staff, 
irrespective of where in the health system the data were originally registered. The vision is to achieve a 
single, cohesiv e health system in which IT and digital processes support continuity of care across hospitals, 
GPs and home care services.  
 
Telemedicine  
In recent years , Denmark has moved  away from many small telemedicine pilot projects to a more 
coordinated effort to est ablish large -scale studies reflecting telemedicine in actual operation.  The National 
Telemedicine Action Plan from 2012 operates with five specific telemedicine initiatives, which form the basis 
for a telemedicine program me to pioneer future telemedicine initiatives. Examples of cross -sectorial large -
scale telemedicine studies that are being rolled  out are TeleCare Nord and tele medical wound assessment 
(see page 38).  
 
A national infrastructure for telemedicine is establishe d as part of the large -scale implementation  of 
telemedicine in operation. This includes standards and relevant reference architectures spanning the entire 
healthcare system, covering data measurement, video, questionnaires and images. The goal is to have a  
digital infrastructure and IT architecture in place within the foreseeable future, so that relevant information 
can be exchanged across the healthcare system and other sectors.  
 
Visibility of results  
Denmark is a world leader in unique healthcare registe rs and infrastructure for linking data across registers 
and databases. Our biobanks and registers provide detailed information on the entire population that can be 
used for research and improvement of healthcare  services .   
 
A reform to improve the “visibility of results” has been initiated and marks a commitment to a national long -
term strategy for better use of healthcare data and for creating greater transparency of health outcomes and 
results.     
 
                                                 
3 MedCom was established in 1994 as a public funded, non -profit cooperation. MedCom facilitates the cooperation between authorities, 
organi sations and private firms linked to the Danish healthcare s ystem . MedCom is financed and owned by the Ministry of Health, 
Danish Regions and Local Governme nt Denmark.   
38 
 Denmark has a long tradition for collecting and using data on both quality of care, activity and costs , and the 
healthcare system has a comparatively mature infrastructure for data collection and for storing data in 
national healthcare databases. This provides a potential for better use of data and for r ealising the benefits 
of greater transparency of outcomes.  
 
The visibility of results reform will contribute to:  
 
 better treatment and care  through systematic monitoring and benchmarking of results and outcomes 
leading to the dissemination of best practices ; 
 Targeted prevention  based on data that will predict risks, ensure timely diagnosis and enable 
effective early interventions ; 
 relevant pa tient information through easy access to comparing quality of care, waiting time and 
outcomes, including patient rated outcomes across hospitals and care providers ;  
 increased access to healthcare data for citizens, journalists, researchers and others who study and 
compare, for example, variations in treatment standards and quality of care ; and      
 increased data based management through the systematic use of data to benchmark results and 
outcomes in order to support a more efficient and outcome oriented healthcare system .    
 
Health data program me 
As part of the “visibility of results” reform, a Health Data Program me was established in 2014 to run over a 
four-year period. The vision of the Health Data Program me is to create “better healthcare through better use 
of data” , and four separate program me tracks ha ve been defined to support this vision:  
 
 New data model and user interface. D eveloping a modernised data model and easy accessible  user 
interface that gives better access to relevant healthcare data for healthcare professionals, 
researchers, administrators and citizens . 
 Modernised infrastructure. D eveloping the IT  infrastructure for national health data management at 
the National Health Data Agency including a  modernised data platform .   
 Better data quality. E nhancing quality of the healthcare data by establishing a new national 
governance model for monitoring data quality in order to support higher validity and reliability of 
healthcare data .  
 Better cross -sectorial cooperation. A new governance model for health data management to support 
cross -sectorial cooperation.  
 
Legal aspects of data collection  and the use of data  
The Danish data regulations provide good access for using healthcare data for research projects or clinical 
trials, provided  they meet the basic requirements of being of general societal importance, data are handled 
and used in a lawful, secure and safe manner, and the individual’s right to privacy is respected.  The Danish 
Data Protection Agency oversees that the legal requirements concerning healthcare data are satisfied before 
data are used  in research projects or clinical trials.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
39 
 Telemedicine  
The TeleCare Nord project aims at ensur ing close monitoring of patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients measure their oxygen saturation, heart rate , blood pressure and 
weight a couple of times a week , and the results are transmitted electronically to healthcare professi onals 
at the local hospitals who analyse the data and adjust medication and treatment  if needed . By measuring 
their health, patients also become aware of how they can ease life with COPD – for example by seeing 
the effects of exercise and diet on oxygen sa turation and heart rate . The project helps to bring down the 
number of  hospital admission days , and telemedicine is  less time -consuming than ordinary treatment 
methods.  
Tele-Care Nord is a joint partnership between municipalities, the region s and the GPs.  This large -scale 
project, in which all stakeholders in the healthcare system collaborate across organisational levels, is 
unprecedented in Europe. The results have led to an agreement to roll out tele -health for COPD patients 
in all municipalities and reg ions by 2019.  
 
Tele-medical wound assessment  
A national roll -out project is designed to expand tele -medical wound assessment throughout Denmark  
and aims to include up to 70 per  cent of all relevant patients by 2017. The method involves a trained 
nurse who  attends to patients’ wounds in their own homes or at the local health clinic, taking photographs 
of the wounds and uploading  the information to the patient’s online health record , which can be accessed 
by a specialist at the hospital (and by the patient).   
Again, this method reduces hospital admission days, saves time for healthcare professionals  and 
minimises transport time for patients. The project is also expected to improve the skills of the nurses 
administering wound care and increase patient satisfac tion. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
40 
  
 Cancer  
 
 
 
 
 
Cancer  
 
 
 
 
In Denmark, the cancer mortality rate has dec lined  in 
the last couple of years. Improving cancer treatment 
has high priority in the healthcare system, and 
cancer patients have a number of options for 
treatment in Denmark and abroad.  
 
Just over 200,000 Danish people have at some point 
in their lives been diagnosed with cancer. Even 
though cancer is the most common cause of death in 
many EU countries – including Denmark – mortality 
from cancer has decreased over the last decade. In 
Denmark, the cancer mortality rate has decreased 
from 260 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008 to 
233 in 2014. The five -year cancer survival rate has 
increased since the year 2000. In 2012 -2014, the 
survival rate was 61 per cent. This is an increase of 
13 percentage points compared to 200 0-2002.  
A comprehensive development and extension of 
cancer treatment  aims at ensuring fast, skilled and 
safe treatment for cancer patients. ‘Integrated patient 
pathways’ and statutory maximum waiting times 
ensure a fast track for cancer patients, and the Danish Health Authority monitors progress in the 
field of cancer trea tment.  
The government has continuously emphasised the 
need to strengthen efforts to combat cancer through 
three national cancer plans. A new  fourth  Cancer 
Action Plan was launched in the summer of 2016.  
Danish people also have access to a number of 
vacci nation programmes free of charge. The HPV 
vaccine, which reduces risk of cervical cancer, is 
part of the Danish childhood immunisation 
programme and is reco mmended for girls aged 12 -
18.  
Furthermore, national screening programmes aim at 
identifying individuals at risk of developing breast 
cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer. 
Screening for breast cancer is offered every other 
year to women aged 50 -69. Cervical cancer 
screening is offered every third year to women aged 
23-49 and every fifth ye ar to women aged 50 -64. 
Screening for colorectal cancer is offered every other 
year to all Danes aged 50 -74.

Cardiovascular Diseases  
 
 
Denmark has seen the largest decline in the 
mortality rate related to ischemic heart disease 
among OECD countries. Continuity of care is 
ensured by a comprehensive, standardised 
treatment programme offered to patients with certain 
types of heart disease.  
Heart disease is common in Denmark. In 2011, 
around 430,000 Danish people suffered from a heart 
disease.  
During the last decades, the mortality rate related to 
cardiovascular diseases has dropped significantly in 
Denmark. The same pattern is seen in other  EU 
countries. In Denmark, mortality caused by 
cardiovascular diseases has decreased by 69 per 
cent from 2005 to 2012. In 2012, 139 out of 100,000 
inhabitants died from cardiovascular diseases in 
Denmark.  
Compared to other OECD countries, Denmark ranks 
among the countries with the lowest mortality rate 
related to ischemic heart disease. A report from  
  
 
2015 (data from 2013) showed that  mortality caused 
by ischemic heart disease had fallen by 77 per cent 
from 1990 to 2013, and only 71 out of 100,000 
inhabi tants died from ischemic heart disease in 
Denmark compared to the OECD average of 117.   
Many patients who suffer from cardiovascular 
diseases require rehabilitation after surgery, and to 
meet their needs, National Clinical Guidelines on 
cardiac rehabilita tion have been developed. The 
guidelines describe present knowledge and provide 
recommendations to support consistent high -quality 
rehabilitation across regions, municipalities and 
professional groups. The rehabilitation offered may 
include physical exerci se, support for dietary 
changes, smoking cessation and psychosocial help.  
Since 2010, patients with certain types of serious 
heart diseases have been offered a comprehensive 
standardised treatment programme to ensure 
timeliness, quality and continuity of care. There are 
also special rules on maximum waiting time for 
treatment of  certain life-threatening heart diseases.

9. Medicine s and Pharmac ies 
Ensuring equal access to high -quality 
medicines for the Danish population is 
important  to the Danish healthcare 
system.  
 
Licensing of medicine s and 
pharmacovigilance  
Medicine s must be authorised by the 
Danish Medicines Agency or by the 
European Commission before they can 
be placed on the Danish market . With a 
marketing authorisation follows the 
responsibility to monitor potential side 
effects of the medicine  as well as an 
obligation to report the m to the authorities 
on a regular  basis. Data about side effects are published in regular reports by the Danish Medicines Agency.  
 
The Danish Medicines Agency and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) monitor the safety of medicines . 
Within the EU , the national medicines agencies maintain a register of reported side effects from which 
information is shared with EMA, the European Commission, national medicines agencies and the 
pharmaceutical company concerned . EMA registers information about side eff ects from all EU Member 
States in one joint pharmacovigilance database (EudraVigilance).  
 
Procurement and medicine pricing  
In Denmark , pharmaceutical companies are free to set the official prices o f medicine. However, members of 
the Danish Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry are  subject to a price -cap agreement between  the 
Association, the Ministry of Health and the Danish Regions. The procurement and pricing procedure s differ 
between the hospital sector and the primary healthcare sector.  
 
The hospital sector  
In Denmark, 99 per cent of all medicines used at public hospitals are purchased through the pharmaceutical 
procurement service Amgros, which is owned by the five regions. Amgros carries out tendering procedures 
and purchases medicines for a ll public hospitals.  
 
All hospital medicines are paid for by the regions, and all treatments in public hospitals, including medicines, 
are provided free of charge to the patient.  
 
The primary healthcare sector  
The actual pricing of medicine s for the primary healthcare sector varies depending on whether the re are 
directly competing products . The p rices of directly competing medicines from the generic i ndustry are set by  
44 
 14-day auctions . Following each  tender , the pharmaceutical companies will report their prices for the 
following two weeks to the Danish Medicines Agency. This information is communicated to all pharmacies, 
which mean s that prices are the same throughout Denmark . The system has proven to ensure price -
transparency and market compe tition.  
 
Medicines with no directly competing products that  have been granted  reimbursement by the Danish 
Medicines Agency are included in the price -cap agreement between the Danish Association  of the 
Pharmaceutical Industry , the Danish Regions and the Ministry of Health.  
 
Reimbursement  of medicines  
While medicines used in public hospitals are provided free of charge, there is a comprehensive 
reimbursement system that entitles patients to reimbursement when they buy medicin e from a private 
pharmacy.  
 
The Danish Medicines Agency decides whether a medicine  is eligible for  public reimbursement. The 
decisions are based on recommendations given by the Danish Reimbursement Committee.  
 
There are different types of reimbursement. Many prescribed medicines come with general reimbursement 
which automatically ensures patients reimbursement when they buy medicine. Patients do not need a special 
authorisation to obtain general reimbursement, b ut for some medicines, reimbursement is only available if 
certain criteria are satisfied (for example it may be required that the patient belongs to a certain patient group 
or suffers from a specific disease). Another type of reimbursement is the individua l reimbursement for 
medicine; i.e. reimbursement which is awarded to the patients personally.  
 
The reimbursement scheme is a needs -based system allocating public reimbursement to patients with the 
highest  consumption of medicines and consequently those wi th the highest expenses.  
 
The amount of reimbursement is automatically calculated at the pharmacy. Reimbursement rates vary from  
0 to 100 per  cent depending on the patient's prior consumption of medicine within a period of one year. The 
maximum amount of patient co -payment is adjusted on a yearly basis. The reimbursement system is based 
on generic substitution , which means that the amount of reimbursement is calculated on the basis of the 
cheapest generic medicine. If patients choose to buy a more expensiv e medicine, they will have to pay the 
price difference themselves.  
 
Pharmacies  
As of 2016, there are about 240 private pharmacies and 140 branch pharmacies, including hospital 
pharmacies. The regions are responsible for the pharmacies at hospitals and dete rmine the number of 
hospital pharmacies, while private pharmacies are owned by a proprietary pharmacist and licensed by the 
Danish Medicines Agency. A license can only be given to a pharmacist and not to a company. The Danish 
Medicines Agency  determines the number of private pharmacies as well as their location. A proprietary 
pharmacist may establish branch pharmacies within a distance of 75 km. A proprietary pharmacist cannot 
own more than eight pharmacies, including branch pharmacies.  
 
Privat e pharmacies have a monopoly on the sale to consumers of prescription -only medicines (POM) and 
also some over -the-counter (OTC) medicines. A number of OTC medicines can be bought from  pharmacies 
as well as from supermarkets or health and beauty retailers . 
  
45 
 Pharmacy mark -ups are  regulated by law. Pharmacies receive a dispensary fee whenever they sell a 
prescribed product, i.e. POM and OTC medicines sold on prescription. Pharmacies and other shops sell ing 
OTC  medicines are free to set the price of these produ cts. 
 
Medical devices  
Medical devices and in vitro diagnostic are regulated by EU directives that are implemented in Danish law.  
 
Only CE marked medical devices can be placed on the Danish market. The CE mark shows that the device 
meets the legal requirements for medical devices in the EU. The manufacturer must document the product's 
quality, safety and performance and ensure complia nce with relevant technical requirements (conformity 
assessment).  
 
Depending on the risk class of the device, the manufacturer must choose a notified body to review the 
documentation in connection with the conformity assessment procedure. A notified body is a private 
organisation designated by the national health authorities to review and assess whether the manufacturer's 
documentation meets the legal requirements.  
  
New EU  legislation  on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic (IVD) is currently underway.  The aim is to 
strengthen patient safety and support innovation in the industry and to further harmoni se the rules regarding 
medical  devices and IVD.  
 
Health research  
The development of new technologies and treatment options in health is rapidly  moving forward . New 
technologies, treatments and interventions may give rise to a number of ethical issues . 
 
The Danish Council o n Ethics is an independent council that advises the Danish Parliament and promotes 
public debate on biotechnology and genetic technologies that affect humans, nature, environment and  food. 
The work of the Council is based on the respect for people, the inte grity and dignity of future generations and 
respect for nature and the environment.  
  
The overall responsibility for health research and funding lies with the Danish Ministry of Higher Education 
and Science. However, the Ministry of Health plays an import ant role in Danish health research and is 
responsible for legislation on e.g. clinical trials on humans. In cooperation with other relevant authorities, 
universities and private organisations, the Ministry of Health participates actively in formulating str ategic 
priorities for Danish health research. Furthermore, the Ministry  of Health  has resources to provide  funding for 
smaller  research projects in priority areas.  
 
All research projects in Denmark involving human beings or any kind of human tissue s or cells, etc. require 
authorisation from an ethics committee. In case of trial projects involving medicin es and medical devices, the 
Danish Medicines Agency  must also approve the project.  
 
In Denmark, r esearch is carried out under the auspices of many different bodies: in universities and other 
establishments of higher education, in hospitals, in the primary health care sector, in ministerial research 
institutions and in private companies. This means that  the responsibility for and financing of health research 
are shared among a number of authorities and private institutions.  
  
46 
 Statens Serum Institut (SSI) is an agency under the Mini stry of Health responsible for the surveillance and 
control of infectio us diseases, biological threats and congenital disorders. SSI also carries out r esearch and 
development within its areas of activity.  
 
New clinical trials regulation under way 
A new EU regulation on clinical trials is expected to come into effect in 2018. In the future, applicants will 
have access to a single portal for submission of applications via a common EU portal and central database 
instead of having to apply in each Memb er State as is the case today. The EU portal and database will also 
be accessible to the public and provide information about clinical trials conducted in the EU.   
47 
  
Access to medicine: pricing  
process es, uptake  of medicine and 
the reimbursement system   
 
 
For up-take in the hospital sector , the political 
parties in the Danish Parliament have collectively 
agreed on seven principles for prioritisation of 
hospital medicine in recognition of the increasing 
expenditure . 
 
The principles are:  
 
1. Professional competence  
 
2. Independence  
 
3. Geographic equality  
 
4. Transparency  
 
5. Rapid uptake of new, effective medicine  
 
6. More value for money in health  
 
7. Access to treatment  
The principles serve as the basis  for the future 
work of the coming Medicine s Council  that will be 
established by the Danish regions . Among other 
things, the Medicines Council will be in charge of 
the uptake of  new medicine  in the hospital sector .

10. Financing of Healthcare and 
Elderly Care  
In Denmark, all citizens are entitled 
to publicly financed healthcare. In 
2014, total Danish health 
expenditure amounted to 10.6 per  
cent of GDP. This is above the 
OECD average of 8.9 per  cent, cf. 
figure 11 on page 51 . Public health 
expenditure alone account s for 8.9 
per cent of GDP.  
 
The financing of healthcare in 
Denmark is shared by the state and 
the municipalities.  
 
The regions are responsible for the 
public hospitals, the general practitioners (GPs) and s pecialists  in private practice , whereas the 
responsibility for other primary healthcare services, including elder ly care, lies with the municipalities.  
 
Healthcare expenditure at regional level is financed by a block grant from the government, an activity -
based subsidy  from the government, and co -financing from the municipalities.  
 
The municipalities also receive a block grant from the state and collect council taxes.  
 
The financing of the healthcare system is based on annual financial agreements between  the 
government , regions and municipalities. The parties agree on a set of objectives for the level of 
healthcare expenditure for the coming year.  
 
Regional financing  
The most significant source  of regional financing is the block grant from the government (approximately 
75 per  cent of the total regional funding). In order to enable all the regions to offer the same level of 
healthcare services, the subsidy is allocated on the basis of criteria reflecting the specific requirements of 
each region, including d emography and social structure.  
 
Besides the block grant , the regions receive an activity -based subsidy from the government based on the 
amount of patient -related activity within the hospitals of the region. Patient -related activity is dependent 
on the number of patients, their diagnos es, whether they need surgery , etc. Furthermore, the regions 
receive an activity -based subsidy from the municipalities which is described below.

Local financing  
The municipalities have the authority to collect taxes , but are also supported by a system of central 
government grants, reimbursements and equalization schemes. Block grants from the central government 
are divided among the municipalities in proportion to their tax base. The equalization scheme is included 
in the block grants and ensures that the municipalities have more uniform conditions for taking care of 
municipal responsibilities.  
 
The municipalities are encouraged by the government to initiate efficient disease prevention and health 
promoti on policies. The municipalities pay an activity -based subsidy  to the regions. The activity -based 
subsidy  depends on the degree to which the citizens of a municipality use the  regional healthcare 
services . It is based on the number of hospitali sations and outpatient treatments at hospitals , but also on 
the amount of services provided by the GPs. In this way , the municipalities have an incentive to 
implement effective preventive measures  that reduce demand for hospitali sation and other regional 
healthcare se rvices.  
 
The regions determine the leve l of activity -based subsidy  from the municipalities (a fixed rate of 
approximately EUR 255 per citizen in 2013). If at least 2/3 of the municipalities in the region oppose  a 
proposal to increas e the subsidy , they can veto it.  
 
The annual financial agreements  
The annual financial agreements are negotiated every year between the government and the 
associations representing the regions and the municipalities. All parties act as an equal partner in the 
negotiations.  
The annual financial agreements establish a fixed level of public expenditure. The main purpose of the se 
agreement s is to make the regions and municipalities deliver on budget limits and targets. This also 
means that the regions and municipalities are auto nomous in the day -to-day running of hospitals and 
other healthcare services. An important policy objective of the financial agreements is the requirement of 
an annual productivity increase of 2 per  cent in the regions. If this target is not reached , it will affect next 
year’s budget for that region.

 The annual financial agreements are a part of the annual National Budget and as such also a part of the 
national budget law. The objectives of the budget law are to support the credibility of the fiscal policie s, to 
strengthen governance of public expenditure and to make sure that the overall costs do not exceed the 
agreed budget. The budget law establishes  a limit of public expenditure  for four -year period , which is 
passed by the Danish Parliament.   
 
Special funds   
In addition to the general financing, Danish health and elderly care is financed through a special funding 
scheme covering  the social, health and labour market areas called “Satspuljeaftalen”. The purpose of this 
special fund is to improve condition s for disadvantaged citizens and citizens who receive public welfare 
benefits . 
 
The special funds are allocated to specific objectives on the basis of a political agreement between the 
political parties in Danish Parliament. Examples of projects could be:  
 
 National action plan for dementia , 
 Establishment of special rooms for safe and hygienic drug use , and  
 Follow -up home visits for vulnerable elderly  people .   
 
Welfare benefits  are regularly adjusted by a rate determined on the basis of the yearly wage development 
in the private sector. If the wage development exceeds 2.0 per  cent, new funds of up to 0.3 per  cent of 
the total public expenditure for welfare benefits may be alloca ted to the special funding scheme. Hence, 
the size of the fund is dependent on the wage development.  
 
The Ministry of Health and the Danish Health Authority monitor the use of the extraordinary funds in the 
area of health and elderly care.

Notes: Public health expenditure covers the goods and services provided to citizens free of charge through the public health system. Public expenditure 
is calculated as the sum of public production and social benefits minus  the sale of goods and services i ncluding patient co -payments. Public expenditure 
consists of both operating cost and capital expenditure. Note the decrease in GDP from 2008 to 2009, which is the reason for the jump in the relative size 
of the public health expenditures in 2009.
